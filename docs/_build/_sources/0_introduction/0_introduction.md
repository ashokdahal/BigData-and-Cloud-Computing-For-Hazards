## Sign up for Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem
We are going to use the cloud processing platform **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem** to carry out our exercises. It's a cloud platform hosted by the European Commission, ESA and Copernicus.The processing will happen there and you will get 1000 free credits. That's enough to complete the course.

## Your first steps in the Coding Environment
We will do all of the excercise in the CRIB server of ITC as a coding enviroment. From there you will be able to connect to the EU cloud computing facilities and perform all the tasks.
