# 3.1 Data Processing

## Learning Objectives

- Carry out an EO workflow on a cloud platform
- Select suitable data
- Chain processes to form an EO processing chain/workflow
- Visualize the results

## Introduction

In this lecture we are going to combine the knowledge and hands-on experience we have gathered so far to create a full EO workflow on a cloud platform.
We will  

- define a research question,
- choose and load the necessary data sources,
- define the data cube to our needs,
- use functions to process the data,
- visualize the result
- and track the resources we are consuming on the platform.

## Case Study: Landslide Mapping in Japan
This case study will be demonstrated physically to describe what are the research questions and why we need to map the landslides and how we can do that better.
